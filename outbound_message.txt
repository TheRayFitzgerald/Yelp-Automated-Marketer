Hope you don’t mind me messaging you out of the blue, but I think it will be worth your while by the time you get to the bottom of my short message.

I know you must be a very busy person so let me tell you why I’m sending you this message - I used to a run a small coffee shop here also and got tired of being screwed over by the likes of Uber Eats and Grubhub when it was already hard to make ends meet on my margins. A couple of us are software developers by trade, so we built a platform that does everything that Uber Eats and Grubhub do called Servuss and launched it in Ireland.

I wanted to do things differently, I wanted to build something for small business owners like you and me run by small business owners. We just launched Servuss in the Northeast, and we are scaling our US operations. We now have 2 stores in Stamford and a few more on the way.

The bottom line is, I’d love to talk to you, get your two cents on the business we’re building and see if it would be of any help to you guys at %s.

I’m not here to give you a sales pitch, I’m really driven by the vision of building the rebellion here, the rebellion of small business owners, restauranteurs, cafe owners, and bodega owners, the cornerstones of our communities against the likes of Square, Uber Eats, and Grubhub who try and suck up our margins.

Servuss doesn’t charge small businesses anything! We make our money by charging the larger corporations and franchises that use our system and use those funds to support smaller merchants.

I’d love to have 15 minutes of your time to have a chat:)

Kind Regards,
